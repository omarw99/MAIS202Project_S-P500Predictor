# MAIS202Project_SP500Predictor
This is my first attempt at a Machine Learning project that unfortunately failed. The aim was to find a relationship between the top daily news headlines and how the S&P500 Index performs that same day. As the S&P500 Index is often used as an indicator of the overall health of the United States Stock Market, it would make sense for there to be a relationship between major news and how it performs. Thus, this project was set up as a supervised NLP regression task. However, the models deployed would all output a constant value regardless of the given headline, and thats because no significant relationship was established between the headlines and S&P500 Index performance. Therefore, this project remains incomplete.
